Apple stock prediction using Holt-winters Method

About the Dataset:-For this project,I was provided with a dataset by AI Varient.The dataset contained historical stock prices of a Apple company. The dataset included daily stock prices for several years, along with other variables such as trading volume, opening and closing prices.I used this dataset to develop and evaluate time series model for forecasting the stock price for the next 30 days.

Introduction:-In this project,I have explored the dynamics of stock prices over time and developed a model to predict the prices for the next 30 days. The goal of this project was to provide investors and traders with a reliable tool for making informed decisions and maximizing their returns. The stock market is a complex and dynamic system, influenced by a wide range of factors such as global events, economic indicators, and company news. Therefore, accurate forecasting of stock prices is a challenging task that requires advanced analytical tools and techniques.

Problem statement:-Predict the apple stock price for next 30 days. There are Open, High, Low and Close price given for each day starting from 2012 to 2019 for Apple stock.

Methodology used for forecasting:-I have evaluated several time series models for forecasting the stock price, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters.I have compared the performance of each model by measuring the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) on the test dataset.My analysis showed that while ARIMA and SARIMA performed reasonably well,the Holt-Winters method outperformed them with the lowest MAPE value. This suggested that the Holt-Winters method was better suited for my dataset, as it was able to capture the trend and seasonality in the data more accurately. Additionally, i have found that the Holt-Winters method was easy to interpret and implement, making it a practical choice for my project.Therefore,I have selected the Holt-Winters method for forecasting the stock price for the next 30 days.

Limitations of the model:-Other time series forecasting methods, such as ARIMA and SARIMA, are also widely used and can provide accurate forecasts in certain contexts. These methods often require more expertise and computational resources than the Holt-Winters method, but can be useful when dealing with complex or non-stationary data.

Improving the model and user interface:-However, there are opportunities for future improvements in both selecting the model(Holt-Winters method) and the user interface.Improvement in the model could be to explore alternative forecasting models that are better suited for non-stationary data, such as machine learning algorithms. And when it comes to improve user interface we can we receive the feedback from users on its usability and functionality. This feedback can be used to make improvements to the interface, such as incorporating additional features or improving the visualizations. Additionally, user feedback can help identify areas where additional documentation or support may be needed to improve user adoption and satisfaction.

Acknowledgement:-I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our project trainer for their guidance and support throughout this project, as well as our mentors for their invaluable advice. I would also like to extend my appreciation to the data providers for providing us with the necessary data to conduct our analysis. Thank you all for your support and contributions to this project.
